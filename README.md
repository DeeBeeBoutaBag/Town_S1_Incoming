# Summer '25 Incoming Cirriculum

## Overview:
- This summer, our geniuses will embark on an immersive 7-week journey designed to ignite their passion for technology, equip them with essential life skills, and cultivate their leadership potential. The program begins with a foundational exploration of computer science principles and hands-on Python programming, quickly advancing into core web development skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enabling students to build their own dynamic, responsive websites. Interwoven throughout the weeks are College Readiness workshops, providing strategies for academic success and personal growth as our students prepare for higher education. At the same time, geniuses will deep-dive into Radical Social Entrepreneurship—a transformative approach to addressing social challenges with innovative, sustainable solutions—developing their own ventures to drive meaningful change. Leadership discussions are a central theme, focusing on identity, voice, and impact, particularly in the context of what it means to be black in a global society. Through critical self-reflection, peer collaboration, and real-world projects, learners will strengthen crucial life skills like emotional intelligence, resilience, and effective communication. By summer’s end, our geniuses will emerge empowered with the technical, entrepreneurial, and life skills necessary to lead with vision and make a radical impact on the world.
