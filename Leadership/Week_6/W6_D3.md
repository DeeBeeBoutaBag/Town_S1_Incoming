## Lesson 3: The Myth of "Reverse Racism"

### **Duration:** 45 minutes

### **Lesson Overview:**
Geniuses will examine the origins and use of "reverse racism"—what it means, why it was invented, and why it does not describe real prejudice or power dynamics. Students will analyze the Southern Strategy and discuss the impact of false equivalence arguments.

### **Objectives:**
- Explain why "reverse racism" does not exist as a systemic force.
- Identify the history and use of the term, including George Wallace and the Southern Strategy.
- Examine real vs. false claims of discrimination.

### **Materials:**
- Video or short reading: history of the Southern Strategy
- Scenario cards: "affirmative action," "hostile behavior," "loss of privilege"
- Chart paper

### **Standards:**
- Social Studies: History, politics, power
- SEL: Media literacy, argument analysis

### **Lesson Activity:**

#### 1. Introduction (7 min)
- Share definition: “Reverse racism” is claimed by whites when they feel threatened by equality programs or lose unfair advantages.
- Briefly introduce George Wallace, the 1968 Southern Strategy, and political use.

#### 2. How the Term Is Used (10 min)
- Watch a segment or read about Wallace/Southern Strategy.
- Discuss: “How does claiming ‘reverse racism’ distract from real issues?”

#### 3. Scenario Analysis (13 min)
- Small groups: Look at scenarios (e.g., affirmative action, Black-focused scholarships, protests).
- Ask: “Does this show actual oppression and the power to enforce it? Or is it about loss of unearned privilege?”

#### 4. Debunking & Discussion (10 min)
- Chart the difference between real racism and claims of “reverse racism.”
- Share back: Why is the myth harmful to racial justice?

#### 5. Closure (5 min)
