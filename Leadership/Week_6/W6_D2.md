## Lesson 2: Racism—Beyond Prejudice: Power and Oppression

### **Duration:** 45 minutes

### **Lesson Overview:**
This lesson explores racism as “prejudice plus power,” not just personal dislike but a system of advantage and oppression. Geniuses will differentiate racism from prejudice and analyze how power works.

### **Objectives:**
- Understand and articulate the definition of racism as prejudice plus power.
- Differentiate racism from internalized and interpersonal prejudice.
- Identify systems that give power to racial prejudice.

### **Materials:**
- Chart paper/markers
- "Power & Prejudice" T-chart
- Historical/current event cards (redlining, discrimination, police, etc.)

### **Standards:**
- Social Studies: Systems, power, race
- SEL: Social analysis, critical thinking

### **Lesson Activity:**

#### 1. Introduction (8 min)
- CWS/Peoples Institute definition: Racism = Race prejudice + Power.
- Reflection: Is prejudice enough to call something racism? Why or why not?

#### 2. Prejudice vs. Racism T-Chart (10 min)
- As a class, list examples of prejudice (personal bias) vs. racism (systemic, with power).
- Fill out T-chart together.
- Clarify: Racism requires the “weight” of power and control in law, education, jobs, etc.

#### 3. Systems in Action (15 min)
- Groups get cards describing real events: laws, policies, media, policing.
- Analyze: “How does power make these more than just personal bias?”

#### 4. Personal Reflection (7 min)
- “Have you ever seen power used to back up prejudice?”
- Quick writes or paired sharing.

#### 5. Closure (5 min)
- Recap: “Racism is more than saying bad things—it’s having the power to enforce it.”
- Next up: Where the idea of ‘reverse racism’ comes from and why it’s misleading.
