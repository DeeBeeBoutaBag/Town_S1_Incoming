# Lesson Plan: Taking Power—Sovereignty, Innovation, and Black Futures

## **Duration:**
45 minutes

## **Lesson Overview:**
Geniuses will explore the concept of sovereignty—self-governance and control over one’s destiny—through modern tech, entrepreneurship, and leadership examples from Black communities. Through collaborative brainstorming, creative pitching, and group discussion, students will imagine and plan their own initiatives for greater community power.

## **Objectives:**
- Define sovereignty and why it matters for Black communities and youth.
- Examine how tech and entrepreneurship can achieve self-determination.
- Practice leadership by designing and pitching sovereignty-inspired projects.

## **Materials:**
- Scenario cards (Tech, Entrepreneurship, Leadership)
- Chart paper or poster boards
- Markers, colored pencils, sticky notes

## **Standards:**
- Social Studies: Self-determination, leadership, economics
- SEL: Teamwork, advocacy, creative thinking

## **Lesson Activity:**

### 1. Introduction (5 min)
- Present definition: “Sovereignty means self-governance—having real say and control over your own life, future, and community.”
- Examples:
    - **Entrepreneurship:** Building Black-owned businesses; keeping money and decisions in the community.
    - **Tech:** Black developers in LA create their own apps to solve local issues.
    - **School/Leadership:** Students advocating for culturally relevant STEM.

### 2. Scenario Spark (10 min)
- Divide class into three groups—each gets one scenario card (Tech, Entrepreneurship, Leadership).
    - Group 1 (Tech): Build a mobile app to help people in your neighborhood find jobs, events, or mutual aid.
    - Group 2 (Entrepreneurship): Create an online marketplace for local Black businesses—how do you make it thrive and keep wealth cycling at home?
    - Group 3 (Leadership/School): Your team wants your school to adopt more Black history/innovation in STEM—how do you persuade leaders and build support?
- Each group discusses: Why is sovereignty important in this situation? What’s one big challenge and one unique strength?

### 3. Pitch Perfect! (15 min)
- Groups prepare a short presentation (“pitch”) for their idea:
    1. What problem are you solving for your community?
    2. How does your solution keep power local and responsive?
    3. What help, resources, or allies will you need?
- Use chart paper or poster boards for visuals or flowcharts.
- Each group presents their pitch (3 min each).

### 4. Community Feedback & Brainstorm (10 min)
- Class Q&A for each pitch: “What’s strong? What would help? How can we support or expand this?”
- As a group, make a list: “What are the biggest barriers to sovereignty?” “What strengths do Black communities bring to solve them?”

### 5. Closure (5 min)
- Recap: “Sovereignty is about self-determination, voice, and power—for you and for the whole community.”
- Each genius writes one commitment or idea for how they’ll support community sovereignty (on sticky note, share aloud or post).
- Quick word around: “To me, sovereignty means…”

## **Assessment:**
- Participation in group brainstorming and presentations
- Thoughtfulness and originality of pitches

## **Extra Activities:**
- Start a school-based campaign for more Black-owned business partnerships or Black innovation in tech
- Research and share an example of Black sovereignty in history (e.g., Black Wall Street, Umoja Village, or Liberation schools)
