# Lesson Plan: Digital & Corporate Imperialism—Who Wins, Who Loses?

## **Duration:**
45 minutes

## **Lesson Overview:**
This lesson introduces the modern face of imperialism through technology and business. Geniuses will analyze how tech giants and large corporations control communities, media, and economics to benefit themselves, often at the expense of Black creators, workers, and business owners. Students will engage in real-world scenario debates and collaborative solutions to imagine more equitable futures.

## **Objectives:**
- Define imperialism in both traditional and modern contexts.
- Examine how tech and corporate power forces change or harm in Black communities.
- Use leadership skills to analyze challenges and design community-centered solutions.

## **Materials:**
- Scenario cards (Tech, Social Media, Entrepreneurship, Labor)
- Chart paper or whiteboard
- Markers/post-its
- (Optional) Devices for a digital activity

## **Standards:**
- Social Studies: Economics, technology, power relations
- SEL: Critical thinking, teamwork, media literacy

## **Lesson Activity:**

### 1. Introduction (5 min)
- Present definition: “Imperialism means forcing control over other nations or communities, often for profit.”
- Quick real-world examples:
    - **Tech Angle:** Amazon, Google, Meta control what we see/buy, make it hard for smaller business or diverse creators to be seen.
    - **Entrepreneurship Angle:** Gentrification in LA pushes out Black businesses, big companies come in, community wealth leaves.
    - **Leadership/Worker Angle:** Companies like Uber/Lyft turning to automation/AI, threatening Black and brown drivers’ ability to earn a living.

### 2. Group Scenario Exploration (15 min)
- Divide class into four groups and give each a scenario:
    - Group 1: Social media platforms limit Black creators’ reach and promote harmful stereotypes.
    - Group 2: Tech giants (Amazon, Google) dominate online shopping, squeezing out small/local Black-owned businesses.
    - Group 3: Gentrification pushes out community businesses, rents rise, franchises move in.
    - Group 4: AI/automation threatens jobs for ride-share drivers, most of whom are Black/brown.
- Groups read/discuss: Who has the power? Who gets hurt? Who benefits? How does this relate to “imperialism”?

### 3. Solutions Pitch (15 min)
- Each group creates a quick “solution pitch”:
    - What’s one way the community or leaders could fight back?
    - How could tech/algorithms promote fairness?
    - How could laws or organizing keep local businesses alive?
    - What should companies do to protect workers and equal opportunity?
- Write or draw their ideas on chart paper.
- Each group presents their scenario and solution(s) (2-3 min per group).

### 4. Full-Class Reflection & Brainstorm (7 min)
- Discuss:
    - What patterns showed up across all the scenarios?
    - What power do young people have—online, as buyers, as creators, as leaders?
    - Share other real-life stories or experiences.

### 5. Closure (3 min)
- Recap: Imperialism isn’t just ancient history—it’s happening in new ways, often through tech and business.
- Call to action: “What’s one thing you’ll look out for, avoid, or support to challenge these systems?”
- Quick word around: “Digital justice means…”

## **Assessment:**
- Participation in scenario analysis and solution pitches
- Quality and creativity of proposed solutions

## **Extra Activities:**
- Students research and share one Black-owned business or creator to boost visibility
- Design a social media campaign for algorithmic justice or local entrepreneurship

## **Reflection / Takeaways:**
[Note which issues students related to most, whether they felt empowered or frustrated, and how their solutions addressed both technology and justice.]
