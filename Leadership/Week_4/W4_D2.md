# Lesson 2: NeoColonialism – The New Chains: Exploring Modern Control

### **Duration:** 45 minutes

### **Lesson Overview:**
This session explores neo-colonialism—modern economic, political, and cultural domination of former colonies. Geniuses will investigate case studies, play a resource negotiation game, and reflect on action for liberation.

### **Objectives:**
- Define "neo-colonialism" and show how it differs from old colonialism.
- Identify examples of economic, political, and cultural neo-colonialism affecting Black countries/communities.
- Discuss the impact of neo-colonialism and brainstorm strategies for resistance and self-determination.

### **Materials:**
- Scenario cards (trade deals, foreign influence, debts, cultural exports)
- Resource tokens (beads, coins, or counters)
- Map and chart paper
- Markers

### **Standards:**
- Social Studies: Economics, current events, resistance
- SEL: Problem-solving, collaboration

### **Lesson Activity:**

#### 1. Introduction (5 min)
- Definition: “Neo-colonialism is when foreign powers still control a country’s resources, politics, or culture, even after formal independence, often through trade, debt, or media.”
- Quick recap: “What did countries want after colonialism ended? What did they actually get?”

#### 2. NeoColonialism Scenarios Game (15 min)
- Divide into small groups. Each group acts as the government of a “newly independent” African or Caribbean country.
- Draw scenario cards (e.g. “Foreign company wants your diamonds in exchange for loans,” “Western media dominates music/TV,” “International bank controls your budget”).
- Use resource tokens to “trade,” negotiate, or resist deals. Each round tracks whether the country gains or loses power/wealth/culture.
- Debrief: Which deals felt like freedom, which felt like new forms of control?

#### 3. Case Study Carousel (15 min)
- Brief stations with posters or short readings (examples: France controlling West African currency, IMF/World Bank debt, U.S. military base in Africa, media/global brands in Nigeria, etc.).
- Geniuses rotate and discuss as a group: “How does this affect Black people’s lives, dreams, and culture today?”

#### 4. Building Liberation Strategies (7 min)
- Brainstorm: “If you led your country/community, how would you resist neo-colonialism? What helps protect self-determination?”
- Create a top-5 action steps poster per group.

#### 5. Closure (3 min)
- Round robin: “One word for how you feel after learning about neo-colonialism.”
- Inspire: “Change is possible! History proves people have always found ways to resist and create new futures.”

### **Assessment:**
- Participation in negotiation game and discussions
- Creative ideas for resisting modern control

### **Extra Activities:**
- Research a modern movement for Black self-determination (e.g. #RhodesMustFall, Pan-Africanism, reparations campaigns)

### **Reflection / Takeaways:**
[Which scenarios created the most debate? What forms of resistance did students invent?]
