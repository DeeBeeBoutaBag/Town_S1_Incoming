### **Duration:** 45 minutes

Geniuses will explore the meaning of colonialism and how it shaped the fate, fortunes, and identities of Black people globally. By examining historical examples, interactive mapping, and group discussion, students will build a foundation to understand how colonialism’s legacy continues to impact lives.

### **Objectives:**

- Analyze historical impacts of European colonization in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Americas.
- Connect colonial history to modern systems, cultures, and resistance.

### **Materials:**
- World map (paper or projected)
- Sticky notes or colored labels
- Printed short histories or quotes from Black thinkers
- Markers, chart paper

### **Standards:**
- Social Studies: History, geography, power, identity
- SEL: Empathy, critical thinking

### **Lesson Activity:**

#### 1. Introduction (5 min)
- Present definition: “Colonialism is when one country invades, occupies, and controls another, taking its land/resources and forcing its people under outside rule.”
- Ask: “What comes to mind when you hear 'colonialism'? Where have you seen it in movies, history books, or the world?”

#### 2. Interactive Mapping (10 min)
- Display a world map. Mark countries in Africa, the Caribbean, Americas that were colonized.
- Place sticky notes: “What was stolen or imposed here?” (land, language, people, traditions, wealth)

#### 3. Timeline Dive (15 min)
- In pairs or small groups, read short stories/excerpts: the transatlantic slave trade, the scramble for Africa, Caribbean plantations, Indigenous resistance.
- Groups share: “How were Black people affected? What are examples of resistance or survival?”

#### 4. Analyzing Legacy (10 min)
- Discuss: “Where do you see the effects of colonialism today?” (languages, borders, wealth gaps, cultural erasure, racism)
- Chart group ideas: “Colonialism’s Shadows in Today’s World”

#### 5. Closure (5 min)
- Each genius shares a word or phrase that captures what most impacted them from this lesson.
- Tease: “Next time, we’ll look at NeoColonialism—how control happens now, even after countries become ‘independent.’”
