## Lesson 1: What is Patriarchy? Unpacking the System

### **Duration:** 45 minutes

### **Lesson Overview:**
Geniuses will be introduced to the concept of patriarchy as a social, political, and economic system. We’ll explore examples in everyday life and history, and begin identifying patriarchal norms around us.

### **Objectives:**
- Define patriarchy and identify its key features and impacts.
- Recognize examples of patriarchy in daily life, media, and systems.
- Lay groundwork for discussing the effects and resistance to patriarchy.

### **Materials:**
- Whiteboard/markers
- Chart paper and sticky notes
- Printed quotes/definitions of patriarchy

### **Standards:**
- Social Studies: Inequality, power, gender
- SEL: Awareness, critical thinking, discussion

---

### **Lesson Activity:**

#### 1. Introduction (5 min)
- Share definition from Chris Crass: “A system privileging men/masculinity and oppressing women/queer people, rooted in binary gender roles and linked to white supremacy and capitalism.”
- Quick poll: Where have you seen or heard “patriarchy” before?

#### 2. Group Brainstorm (8 min)
- Ask: “What are things men or boys are “supposed” to do? What about girls/women? Where do these ideas come from?”
- List responses on chart paper under "Patriarchy at Work."

#### 3. Gallery Walk: Examples in Real Life (15 min)
- Around the room post examples (ads, news headlines, story prompts).
- Groups visit each example, discussing: "Who has power here? Who’s expected to act a certain way and why?"
- Write sticky notes of observations, share with group.

#### 4. Group Share & Reflection (10 min)
- What themes showed up? Were there any surprises?
- Connect to definition—how does this system shape our thinking/choices?

#### 5. Closure (7 min)
- Each genius shares one thing they want to challenge or question about gender “rules.”
- Prep for next session: focus will be on the impacts and costs of patriarchy.
