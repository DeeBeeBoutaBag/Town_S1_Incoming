## Lesson 4: Interlocking Oppressions — Patriarchy, White Supremacy, Capitalism

### **Duration:** 45 minutes

### **Lesson Overview:**
Geniuses will learn how patriarchy is connected to other systems of domination, focusing on how intersecting oppressions shape all our lives. Through an interactive web activity, students will map out systems and envision ways to untangle them.

### **Objectives:**
- Understand the connections between patriarchy, white supremacy, and capitalism.
- Use systems thinking to analyze how oppression operates.
- Brainstorm possible actions for solidarity and collective liberation.

### **Materials:**
- Yarn or string
- Cards labeled with “Patriarchy,” “Racism,” “Capitalism,” “Heterosexism,” etc.
- Chart paper/markers

### **Standards:**
- SEL: Systems thinking, empathy, collective action
- Social Studies: Power, intersectionality

### **Lesson Activity:**

#### 1. Introduction (5 min)
- “Patriarchy isn’t alone. How does it relate to other systems, like racism or capitalism?”

#### 2. Systems Web Activity (15 min)
- Each genius gets a card. Stand in a circle. Use yarn to connect different forms of oppression: “How are these linked?” (e.g., gender pay gap = sexism + capitalism).
- As the web forms, discuss tensions and overlaps.

#### 3. Unraveling the Web (10 min)
- “If we want to tackle patriarchy, do we also need to fight racism and classism?” Discuss how liberation in one area strengthens the other.
- Reflect: What could weaken or “snip” the string in the web?

#### 4. Solidarity Brainstorm (10 min)
- Groups list ways people from different communities can support each other's struggles.
- Share out top three ideas (e.g., joint campaigns, cross-issue learning).

#### 5. Closure (5 min)
- “Systems connect, but so do we! One word for how you’ll build collective liberation.”

### **Assessment:**
- Building/untangling the web
- Action ideas for solidarity

### **Extra Activities:**
- Research a historic or current movement that crossed lines (e.g., Black feminist or labor movements)

### **Reflection / Takeaways:**
[Did students see connections? What ideas excited them for future action?]
