### **Lesson Activity:**

#### 1. Introduction (5 min)
- Recap: Patriarchy = system of privilege/power shaped by gender.

  - Men/boys?
  - Women/girls?
  - Queer & non-binary people?
  - Families/communities?

#### 4. Intersectionality (8 min)
- Discuss: How do racism, class, and sexuality *combine* with patriarchy to make it worse for some people?
- Reflect: “Can you think of examples where one group is especially harmed?”

#### 5. Closure (7 min)
- One word check-out: “The cost of patriarchy is…”
