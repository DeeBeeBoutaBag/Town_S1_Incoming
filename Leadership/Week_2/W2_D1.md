# Lesson Plan: Understanding Power (Part 1) — Who Has Power & Why?

## **Duration:**
45 minutes

## **Lesson Overview:**
This interactive session introduces the concept of power as a dynamic and relational force within society. Geniuses will explore key definitions and examples of power, then experience a hands-on simulation to understand how power is distributed and exercised.

## **Objectives:**
- Understand and define "power" in multiple ways.
- Analyze how power shows up in relationships and social settings.
- Experience the effect of unequal power distribution through an engaging activity.

## **Materials:**
- Printed slips of paper or cards with power roles (e.g., Leader, Influencer, Resource Gatekeeper, Regular Member, Outsider)
- Scenario cards (school, neighborhood, business, etc.)
- Stickers or tokens to represent power/resources
- Whiteboard/markers

## **Standards:**
- Social Studies: Civics, social systems, inequalities
- SEL: Empathy, understanding group dynamics, critical thinking

## **Lesson Activity:**

### 1. **Introduction (Time: 7 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Open minds to the idea of power as a relationship and force.
   - "What’s power? Who do you think of when you hear the word?"
   - Present 4 key definitions (on board):
       - Access to legitimate systems
       - The ability to define reality and convince others it’s real
       - Ownership/control of major resources and decisions
       - Access to those who control resources or decisions

### 2. **Mini-Talk and Group Discussion (Time: 8 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Connect definitions to real life.
   - Short talk: "Power is always about relationships—in school, in families, in communities. It has to be *used* to be seen."
   - Ask: Where does power show up in your life? Is it fair? Is it decided or earned?

### 3. **Activity: Power in the Room Simulation (Time: 20 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Make power visible, build empathy, promote critical thinking.
   - Split geniuses into 4-5 groups; hand out secret role cards (Leader, Influencer, Gatekeeper, Regular, Outsider).
   - Each group receives a scenario card (e.g. planning a school event, distributing community resources).
   - Rules: Only those with certain roles can “speak” or make decisions, others must use nonverbal cues or ask for permission.
   - Midway, redistribute a couple roles (“Power Shift!”) and see how dynamics change.
   - Give items/bonus to reward “powerful” decisions.

### 4. **Debrief & Discussion (Time: 7 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Reflect on experience, connect to definitions.
   - Ask: “How did you feel in your role? Who had real power? Did anything feel unfair, and what would you change?”
   - Relate to the Chism/Washington and Nobles/CWS definitions.

### 5. **Closure (Time: 3 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Connect experience to broader systems.
   - "Power is not just something you have—it’s something you do. Next session, we’ll look at how people can gain, share, or challenge power!”

## **Assessment:**
- Participation in simulation and discussion
- Engagement with definitions and real-world connections

## **Extra Activities:**
- “Power Mapping”: Draw examples of power in school/home for homework.

## **Reflection / Takeaways:**
[After teaching: Which power concepts landed? Which roles led to the most discussion? How did geniuses react to power shifts?]
