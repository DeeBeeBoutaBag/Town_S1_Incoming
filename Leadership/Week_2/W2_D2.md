# Lesson Plan: Understanding Power (Part 2) — Building and Challenging Power

## **Duration:**
45 minutes

## **Lesson Overview:**
This session focuses on how power can be assembled, challenged, or re-imagined. Through a creative group activity, geniuses will build their own “power worlds,” set rules, and negotiate for change. The lesson ties back to real-world struggles for justice, representation, and fair resource sharing.

## **Objectives:**
- Identify sources of power and how they can be changed or shared.
- Practice leadership, negotiation, and creative problem-solving.
- Relate personal/group actions to broader social change efforts.

## **Materials:**
- Large sheets of paper or poster board
- Markers, pens
- “Power tokens” (stickers, coins, buttons)
- Scenario prompts for world-building (school, city, organization)

## **Standards:**
- Social Studies: Society, governance, activism
- SEL: Collaboration, negotiation, leadership skills

## **Lesson Activity:**

### 1. **Introduction (Time: 5 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Reflect on previous lesson and set goals.
   - Recap: "Last time, you saw how power functions. Today, you get to build AND challenge it."
   - Pose: “Who would you give power to if you were in charge?”

### 2. **Activity: Power World-Builders (Time: 25 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Create/exercise/challenge power.
   - Split into small groups. Give each a "blank world" (sheet of paper, scenario prompt).
   - Groups design their own mini-society:
       - Who has access to resources?
       - How are decisions made?
       - Who can join or lead?
   - After 10 minutes, introduce a “challenge” card (e.g., protest, new group seeks inclusion, resource shortage, etc.). Groups must adapt—will they share power, defend it, or transform their society?
   - Each group presents their world and how they handled the challenge.

### 3. **Debrief (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Connect learning to change in real life.
   - Discuss: “What did your group do when faced with change? Was it hard to share or give up power? What did you learn about justice and leadership?”
   - Relate decisions to real movements or changes in society.

### 4. **Closure (Time: 5 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Empower students as change-makers.
   - “Power is most visible when it’s exercised—how will you use yours wisely or challenge what’s unfair?”
   - Each genius completes: “The most powerful thing I can do is…”

## **Assessment:**
- Group participation and creativity in designing “power worlds”
- Thoughtful reflection during discussion

## **Extra Activities:**
- Write a letter to a leader, describing how to use power more wisely in the real world.

## **Reflection / Takeaways:**
[After teaching: Which power solutions were creative or surprising? How did groups negotiate sharing power? What real-world parallels did geniuses find?]
