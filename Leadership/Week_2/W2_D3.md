# Lesson Plan: Leadership Topic 1 – Decoding Capitalism: Who Owns, Who Works, Who Wins?

## **Duration:**
45 minutes

## **Lesson Overview:**
This lesson introduces capitalism as a system and explores its core structure: the relationship between owning, working, and power. Geniuses will experience the concept through an engaging, real-world marketplace simulation that makes the rules of capitalism visible.

## **Objectives:**
- Understand the basic structure and goals of capitalism.
- Identify who owns resources, who works, and how wealth is created and distributed.
- Explore how class and power dynamics shape opportunity and oppression.

## **Materials:**
- Play money (bills or tokens)
- “Resource” cards (land, factories, raw materials)
- Labor cards (worker roles)
- Scenario envelopes (market events, strikes, etc.)
- Whiteboard/markers

## **Standards:**
- Social Studies: Economics, class, labor
- SEL: Critical thinking, teamwork, discussion

## **Lesson Activity:**

### 1. **Introduction (Time: 7 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Define and contextualize capitalism.
   - Pose: “Who do you think owns most of the stuff—buildings, land, factories, businesses?”
   - Intro definition: Capitalism = A system where a few (the ruling class) own and control resources; wealth & power come through other people’s (waged/unwaged) labor.

### 2. **Mini-Talk & Discussion (Time: 8 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Make the theory practical.
   - Share examples: Corporate CEOs, landlords vs. tenants, who makes vs. who profits.
   - Discuss: “What does exploitation mean? How might class affect what you experience?”

### 3. **Activity: The Capitalist Marketplace Game (Time: 20 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Experience the flow and impact of capitalist relations.
   - Divide into 3 groups: Ruling Class (owners), Workers (waged), Unwaged Labor (interns/household/family/unpaid).
   - Owners get resource cards and a chunk of play money.
   - Workers “apply” for jobs from the owners (who pay them wages for tasks/jobs).
   - Unwaged labor supports either workers or owners with no “pay” but can earn “bonus” money for essential work.
   - Market events: hand out scenario cards that create booms, strikes, layoffs, or windfalls.
   - After several “rounds,” see who has the most wealth, who struggled most, and why.

### 4. **Debrief & Reflection (Time: 7 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Uncover feelings, lessons, and realities.
   - Ask: “How did it feel to have (or not have) power? Who benefitted the most? What would you change?”
   - Link to real-world examples of strikes, unemployment, or growing rich/poor divides.

### 5. **Closure (Time: 3 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Connect the dots.
   - Recap: “In capitalism, class and ownership often decide your opportunities. Next time, we’ll talk about how this affects society—and how it can be challenged!”

## **Assessment:**
- Participation in simulation and discussion
- Ability to explain who benefits/loses from the system

## **Extra Activities:**
- Research: Find a real-world company, who owns it, and how much workers are paid.

## **Reflection / Takeaways:**
[After teaching: Note engagement, fairness, and any surprises in student strategies or feelings.]
