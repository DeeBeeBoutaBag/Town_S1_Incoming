# Lesson Plan: Leadership Topic 2 – Resisting and Reimagining Capitalism

## **Duration:**
45 minutes

## **Lesson Overview:**
This lesson builds on the first by focusing on how people resist, reform, or challenge capitalism, especially those most affected by class oppression. Geniuses will co-create alternatives by designing a “Just Society” and reflecting on real-world struggles, past and present.

## **Objectives:**
- Describe forms of resistance to capitalist exploitation (strikes, unions, co-ops).
- Analyze the impact of collective action and alternative economic models.
- Collaborate to invent more just systems and rules.

## **Materials:**
- Poster board/large paper
- Markers, stickers, or collage materials
- Scenario cards: Labor strike, Unionize! Community resources, Co-ops, Universal basic income
- Example stories or graphics (about unions, strikes, or co-ops)

## **Standards:**
- Social Studies: Economics, social change, activism
- SEL: Leadership, collaboration, ethical thinking

## **Lesson Activity:**

### 1. **Introduction (Time: 7 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Shift focus from “what is” to “what could be.”
   - Reflect on last lesson (“Who had power in our marketplace game?”).
   - Pose: “What happens when the people who do the work stand together? What’s a strike or a union?”

### 2. **Mini-Talk: Resistance & Alternatives (Time: 8 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Explore real-world examples.
   - Share brief stories: Labor strikes, formation of unions, worker cooperatives.
   - Show quick video clip or infographic if available.
   - Discussion: “Have you ever seen people come together to demand fairness? How did it go?”

### 3. **Activity: Design a Just Society (Time: 22 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Practice collective power and imagination.
   - Split into small groups. Each group creates a “Just Society” poster, addressing:
     - How do people share resources and profits?
     - Who makes decisions?
     - What rules prevent exploitation?
     - How do you keep society fair for all classes?
   - Add drawings, slogans, and symbols. Each group can choose to include unions, co-ops, or other solutions.

### 4. **Gallery Walk & Group Share (Time: 5 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Celebrate creativity and discuss new visions.
   - Groups post their “Just Society” designs. Everyone does a quick walk-through.
   - Volunteers share what they’re most proud of in their imagined world.

### 5. **Closure (Time: 3 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Inspire activism and change.
   - “Many social activists and communities have imagined—and built—fairer systems. What’s one thing you’d like to see changed in the real world?”

## **Assessment:**
- Group participation and creativity in poster-making
- Depth of discussion about what makes a society “just”

## **Extra Activities:**
- Write a letter to a leader about an economic change you want.

## **Reflection / Takeaways:**
[After teaching: What solutions were popular? Did students recognize the power of collective action?]
