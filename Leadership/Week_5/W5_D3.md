# Lesson Plan 1: Understanding White Supremacy — History, Power, and Systems

## **Duration:**
45 minutes

## **Lesson Overview:**
This lesson introduces the concept of white supremacy as an institutionally perpetuated system, not just individual prejudice. Geniuses will explore the historical and ongoing exploitation and oppression of peoples of color—locally and globally—by white-dominated institutions and nations.

## **Objectives:**
- Define white supremacy as a system, not only as personal bias.
- Understand key historical periods and mechanisms of white supremacy.
- Identify how wealth, power, and privilege are maintained through institutions.

## **Materials:**
- Timeline cards (colonialism, slavery, segregation, immigration laws, redlining, etc.)
- Markers/chart paper
- Sticky notes
- (Optional: short video or images related to white supremacy systems or resistance)

## **Standards:**
- Social Studies: History, power, race
- SEL: Critical thinking, social awareness

## **Lesson Activity:**

### 1. Introduction (7 min)
- Write the definition:  
    "White supremacy is an historically based, institutionally perpetuated system of exploitation and oppression of continents, nations, and peoples of color by white peoples and nations of the European continent for maintaining wealth, power, and privilege."
- Discuss: “What do you think of when you hear ‘white supremacy’? How is this different from just ‘hate’ or ‘racism’?”

### 2. White Supremacy Timeline (15 min)
- Distribute timeline cards/events to small groups: colonial conquests, transatlantic slavery, Jim Crow laws, Indigenous genocide, Apartheid, immigration restrictions, redlining, mass incarceration.
- Groups discuss: What was the goal? Who benefitted? Who was targeted?
- Groups place events on a large timeline chart.

### 3. Behind the Curtain: Institutions & Systems (10 min)
- Explain: “White supremacy is NOT just a few bad people; it’s built into government, economy, education, housing, media, and more.”
- Give modern examples: school funding gaps, discriminatory policing, media stereotypes.
- Quick brainstorm: “Where do we see white supremacy at work in society today?”

### 4. Reflection & Naming Truths (8 min)
- Sticky note activity: “Write where you see (or learn about) white supremacy showing up in daily life—nationally or locally.”
- Share and discuss: “How does recognizing the system change how we think about solutions?”

### 5. Closure (5 min)
- Recap: White supremacy is a system with deep roots—but naming it is the first step to challenging it.
- Preview: “Next lesson, we’ll talk about how people resist and dismantle these systems—historically and today!”

## **Extra Activities:**
- Short research on a local example of institutional oppression

## **Reflection / Takeaways:**
[Which historic examples felt most important? Where did students make connections to their lives?]
