# Lesson Plan: White Privilege & Systems of Advantage (Lesson 1)

## **Duration:**
45 minutes

## **Lesson Overview:**
Geniuses will explore the concept of white privilege, understanding its roots in US history and institutions. Students will identify what privilege looks like in everyday life, and begin to critically analyze how advantage and disadvantage interact within the white supremacy system.

## **Objectives:**
- Define privilege and specifically white privilege.
- Analyze how US institutions and culture provide advantage to some and disadvantage to others.
- Recognize examples of white privilege and racial/national oppression in daily life and media.

## **Materials:**
- Whiteboard/markers or chart paper
- Handouts with privilege definitions and real-life scenarios/examples
- Sticky notes
- (Optional) Video or visual (e.g., “Unequal Opportunity Race” clip)

## **Standards:**
- Social Studies: Power, culture, race, systems
- SEL: Critical thinking, empathy, honest self-reflection

## **Lesson Activity:**

### 1. Introduction (8 min)
- Define “privilege” using Webster’s dictionary: a right, favor, advantage, or immunity specially granted to individuals or groups and withheld from others.
- Introduce “white privilege”: system of advantage, historically and institutionally rooted, based on ancestry from Europe.
- Ask: “Where and when have you seen or heard about ‘privilege’ being discussed?”

### 2. Breaking It Down: White Privilege Scenarios (15 min)
- Distribute scenario cards: school discipline, job interviews, housing, media praise, police treatment, etc.
- Small groups read and discuss: “Who is receiving an advantage? Is it fair? What makes it possible?”
- Gather ideas on chart paper with two columns: “Given To” vs. “Withheld From.”
- Discuss: “Is it always about intention? Or is it also about the system?”

### 3. Ideology in US Culture (10 min)
- Review the idea that “US culture teaches white people are superior, others inferior”—give brief examples from media, textbooks, advertising, history talks.
- Ask: “How does this belief show up in schools, TV, workplaces?”
- Write responses on the board.

### 4. Reflection: Advantage & Disadvantage (7 min)
- Sticky note activity: “Write one way privilege (ANY kind) has helped or hurt you or someone you know.”
- Volunteers share out and discuss feelings/reactions.

### 5. Closure (5 min)
- Recap: “Privilege isn’t always about what you get by asking—it’s often about what you never have to worry about or notice.”
- Tease: “Next lesson, we’ll talk about how white privilege functions within systems and how people can challenge it.”
