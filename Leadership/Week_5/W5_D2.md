# Lesson Plan: The Other Side of the Coin—Intersections, Resistance, and Accountability (Lesson 2)

## **Duration:**
45 minutes

## **Lesson Overview:**
Building on the previous session, geniuses deepen engagement with the interplay between white privilege and racial/national oppression. They’ll explore intersectionality (how class, gender, religion interact with race), examine resistance, and consider what accountability and solidarity look like.

## **Objectives:**
- Connect white privilege to the broader system of white supremacy and oppression of people of color.
- Analyze intersections: how can someone be both privileged and oppressed at once?
- Imagine and practice ways to challenge and disrupt these systems.

## **Materials:**
- Intersections diagram or large paper/pens
- Role-play or scenario cards on allyship/resistance
- Chart paper for “Action Steps”

## **Standards:**
- Social Studies: Systems analysis, activism, intersectionality
- SEL: Empathy, action planning, solidarity

---

## **Lesson Activity:**

### 1. Introduction: Two Sides of the Coin (8 min)
- Recap: “Wherever there is oppression, there is privilege—and vice versa.”
- Introduce “intersectionality”: Many non-ruling class white people are BOTH privileged (racially) and oppressed (class, gender, sexuality, etc.).
- Draw a Venn diagram: “How could someone occupy more than one position at a time?”

### 2. Intersectionality Mapping (12 min)
- Each student writes identities they hold (race, gender, class, religion, etc.) on sticky notes.
- Together, build an intersections map.
- In small groups, discuss how their experience in the world can be easier/harder in different spaces because of these overlapping identities.

### 3. Resistance & Allyship Scenarios (15 min)
- Read short resistance scenarios: speaking out, supporting policy change, sharing resources, amplifying BIPOC voices.
- Groups pick a scenario and role-play what good allyship/solidarity looks and sounds like.
- Share with the class and discuss: “What felt hard? What surprised you?”

### 4. Action Steps Brainstorm (7 min)
- On chart paper: “How can we challenge white privilege in our schools/communities?” (E.g., advocate for curriculum changes, support BIPOC businesses, call out injustice, etc.)

### 5. Closure (3 min)
- “Real change isn’t just seeing privilege—it’s working to un-do it.”
- Ask each genius to write down one commitment—big or small—they’ll try based on today’s lesson.

## **Assessment:**
- Engagement in mapping, role plays, and action brainstorm
- Ability to apply lesson to real-life settings

## **Extra Activities:**
- Research a historical or current figure who used their privilege to disrupt racism/white supremacy

## **Reflection / Takeaways:**
[What action steps excited students? Where did they get stuck with the idea of intersectionality or allyship?]
