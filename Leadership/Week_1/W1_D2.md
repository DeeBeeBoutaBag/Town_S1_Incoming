## **Lesson Activity:**

### 1. **Introduction (Time: 5 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Set an open, curious, and celebratory tone.
   - Welcome geniuses and introduce the topic: “Today, we’re diving into what it truly means to be Black, our stories, our strengths, and our voices.”
   - Quick prompt: "When you hear 'Black', what’s the first (positive) word or image that comes to mind?" (Popcorn around for a few responses.)

### 2. **Direct Instruction: Leadership Talk (Time: 8 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Provide context and spark thought.
   - Short talk by educator:
       - "Being Black is more than the color of our skin—it's the story of survival, joy, struggle, brilliance, style, and impact."
       - Highlight the diversity: “There’s not one way to be Black—our cultures, hair, languages, music, and dreams are all different but all powerful.”
       - Introduce Black excellence and legacy: address role models, history, and what pride means.
   - Invite geniuses: "This is your story. How do you own it?"

### 3. **Group Activity: Black Excellence Gallery Walk (Time: 15 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Celebrate individuality AND unity; foster creative expression.
   - **Activity: Create a 'What It Means to Be Black' Gallery**
       - Each genius gets an index card/sticky note and marker.
       - Prompt: “Draw, write, or decorate your card with words/images that represent what being Black means to YOU. It can be family, tradition, food, music, dreams, or whatever speaks to your identity.”
       - After 5 minutes, post cards on the wall/board (or floor).
       - 5 minutes for a “Gallery Walk” where everyone views the cards.
       - Voluntary share: Ask 2-3 geniuses to describe their card and its meaning.

### 4. **Group Game: Culture Charades (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Make learning playful and interactive; highlight shared culture and creativity.
   - Prepare slips of paper with actions or references related to Black culture (examples: "braiding hair," "double dutch," "MLK’s speech," "making gumbo," "doing the electric slide," "first day of school outfit," etc.).
   - Geniuses volunteer one at a time, pick a slip, and act it out—group guesses!
   - Celebrate right answers with positive affirmations (“Black Genius Energy!”).

### 5. **Closure (Time: 7 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Reflect, affirm, and empower.
   - Group reflection: “What did you see, hear, or feel today that inspired you?”
