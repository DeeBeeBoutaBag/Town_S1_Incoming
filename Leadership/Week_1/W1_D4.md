# Lesson Plan: Social Constructs Unplugged (Part 2)  
## **Duration:**  
45 minutes

## **Lesson Overview:**  
In this follow-up, geniuses flip the script by creating their own “countries” with invented values, social rules, and systems. Through creative group activity and discussion, geniuses will connect how social constructs shape societies—by design and choice.

## **Objectives:**  
- Imagine and create a mini-society with unique values and rules.
- Analyze how rules and resources impact people’s lives.
- Demonstrate leadership, collaboration, and critical thinking.

## **Materials:**  
- Large paper or poster boards
- Markers, pens
- Index cards (for laws, values, rights)
- Stickers or fun symbols (for country flags/emblems)

## **Standards:**  
- Social Studies: Governance, civic engagement, society
- SEL: Communication, collaboration, creativity

## **Lesson Activity:**

### 1. **Introduction (Time: 7 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Connect previous lesson, set the challenge.
   - Quick review: “Last time we saw how social constructs and rules can impact power and fairness. What if you could build your OWN country?”
   - Give examples: Which rules keep, change, or toss out?  

### 2. **Activity: Create-a-Country (Time: 23 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Empower geniuses to design society and reflect on social constructs.
   - Split class into 2 groups. Each creates their own country—name it, design a flag, and answer:
      - What are your country’s 3 most important values?
      - What rights does everyone have? Any rules or laws?
      - How do people get resources and opportunities?
      - BONUS: What makes your country unique/fun?
   - Use poster boards, markers, etc. for visuals!
   - After 15 minutes, each group presents their country to the class (3-4 minutes each).

### 3. **Debrief Discussion (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Connect activity to social constructs and leadership choice.
   - Discuss: 
     - What was easy/hard to decide as a group?
     - How did you treat fairness, power, and differences?
     - Do you see social constructs you invented (money, rights, roles)?
   - Reflect: “Every society is a set of agreements. Which ones would make real life more fair, or more fun?”

### 4. **Closure (Time: 5 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Empower for real-world impact.
   - Recap key learning: “You have the power to challenge and change social constructs. Real change starts with imagination and action.”
   - Final share: “Name one thing you’d bring from your invented country into the real world!”

## **Assessment:**  
- Group participation and creativity in country design
- Thoughtful discussion contributions
- Presentation clarity and connection to lesson

## **Extra Activities:**  
- Combine all countries/rules into a “World’s Best Society” mashup poster.
- Write “A Letter to Future Leaders” about building fair societies.

## **Reflection / Takeaways:**  
[After teaching: How did geniuses handle debate/compromise? What rules/constructs did they value most? Which systems would they challenge in the real world?]
