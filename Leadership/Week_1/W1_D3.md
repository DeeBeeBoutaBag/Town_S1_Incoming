# Lesson Plan: Social Constructs Unplugged (Part 1)  
## **Duration:**  
45 minutes

## **Lesson Overview:**  
This session introduces the idea of social constructs—things our society creates and agrees upon that shape how we live and see ourselves and others. Geniuses will experience social constructs in action through an engaging resource negotiation game, sparking critical dialogue about fairness, power, and systems.

## **Objectives:**  
- Define "social construct" and give relevant examples.
- Illustrate how resources and opportunity can be unevenly distributed.
- Practice negotiation, teamwork, and reflection.

## **Materials:**  
- Signs for each corner: Elites, Upperclass, Working Class, Marginalized
- Play money ("bonus money" pot)
- Resource cards (e.g., food, water, education, transportation, internet, healthcare)
- Notepads/paper and pens

## **Standards:**  
- Social Studies: Society, equity, structures of power
- SEL: Teamwork, empathy, critical thinking

## **Lesson Activity:**

### 1. **Introduction (Time: 7 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Spark curiosity, introduce social constructs.
   - Ask: “What’s something that exists because we all agree it does—like money, grades, race, or gender roles?”
   - Discuss: "A social construct is an idea or rule that society creates, not something from nature. These affect how we treat each other and how things are shared."

### 2. **Guided Activity: 4 Corners Social World (Time: 20 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Experience social construct in action & highlight systemic differences.
   - Split geniuses into 4 groups. Assign corners as: Elites | Upperclass | Working Class | Marginalized.
   - Give each corner different starting resources (for example: Elites get multiple resources of each kind, Marginalized get just one or none). Reveal a “bonus pot” of play money in the middle.
   - Instructions: “After quick group planning (3 minutes), groups send a negotiator to the middle. Your mission is to trade, lobby, and make deals for more resources and bonus money. You can combine/share, make alliances, or go it alone—your future depends on it!”
   - After 10 minutes, call time.

### 3. **Debrief and Mini-Talk (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Reflect on feelings and situations—connect to the real world.
   - Discuss: “How did it feel to start with more (or less)? Did all groups have fair chances? Who had the power? Why?”
   - Educator connects activity to social constructs, privilege, and real-world inequalities—emphasize not just what was done, but why the system was accepted or resisted.

### 4. **Closure (Time: 8 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Summarize and affirm learning.
   - Recap: Social constructs shape systems—some are fair, others aren’t, but they all started with someone’s choices.
   - Let each genius share one example of a social construct they encounter in their life, or a rule they wish was different.
   - Tease part 2: "Next time, you’ll get to build your OWN society and rules!"
