# Lesson Plan: Genius Portfolio Project – Launch & Planning

## **Duration:**
1 hour

## **Lesson Overview:**
Geniuses will plan and begin work on their final project: a personalized portfolio website showing off everything they’ve learned—structure, nav, forms, CSS, images, and more. This session focuses on brainstorming, wireframing, and starting to code.

## **Objectives:**
- Plan a multi-page portfolio website.
- Design layout and features with a hand-drawn or digital wireframe.
- Begin building pages using best HTML & CSS practices.

## **Materials:**
- Computers with code editor
- Paper, pencils, or wireframe templates (print or digital)
- Project rubric/checklist
- Example portfolio links

## **Standards:**
- CSTA 2-AP-13, 2-AP-17

## **Lesson Activity:**

### 1. **Introduction (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Inspire genius-level ambition!
   - Show a few impressive (age-appropriate) portfolio site examples.
   - Discuss: “What would YOU want to show about yourself?”

### 2. **Direct Instruction (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Project requirements & planning.
   - Display the rubric: must include nav, 3+ pages, images, a form, lists, and custom CSS.
   - Quick how-to for sketching a wireframe.

### 3. **Guided Practice (Time: 15 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Geniuses wireframe and outline.
   - Each draws/creates a simple map of their site (home, about, projects, etc.)
   - Peer feedback: Each genius trades a plan for a quick “warm or cool” suggestion.

### 4. **Independent Practice (Time: 20 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Start coding!
   - Each genius sets up folders, starter HTML/CSS, and builds Home and Nav Bar.

### 5. **Closure (Time: 5 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Confirm everyone has a plan and a start.
   - Thumbs up/down check: Who needs help getting started?
   - Preview: Build week continues with peer code review next!

## **Assessment:**
Turn in wireframe and have at least two starter HTML pages coded.

## **Extra Activities:**
- Add planning for fun “secret” or “easter egg” page

## **Reflection / Takeaways:**
Verify every genius gets past the “blank page” barrier!
