# Lesson Plan: Linking Pages — Genius Multi-Page Websites

## **Duration:**
1 hour

## **Lesson Overview:**
Geniuses level up to true web developers by creating and linking multiple HTML pages. Their nav bar goes pro as they navigate between Home, About, and a page of their own creation!

## **Objectives:**
- Create multiple HTML files for a multi-page site.
- Link pages together with navigation bar links.
- Understand relative vs. absolute file paths.

## **Materials:**
- Computers with code editor
- Example site diagram (Home/About/Other)
- Whiteboard and markers

## **Standards:**
- CSTA 2-AP-13, 2-AP-17

## **Lesson Activity:**

### 1. **Introduction (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Show value of connected pages.
   - Ask: "Ever get lost on a website? Why do good sites always have a way back?"
   - Display site map diagram.

### 2. **Direct Instruction (Time: 15 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Multi-page mechanics.
   - Demo: Create new pages (about.html, contact.html, etc.).
   - Show: Edit nav bar with relative links (`href="about.html"`).

### 3. **Guided Practice (Time: 15 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Geniuses link pages and test navigation.
   - Each genius makes an “About Me” and “Favorite Stuff” page. Nav bar links them all.

### 4. **Independent Practice (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Personalize site.
   - Add creative text, images, or lists to one new page.

### 5. **Closure (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Recap & check for errors.
   - Test each genius’s nav bar—can you get to every page?
   - Preview: Drop-down nav and CSS nav upgrades coming!

## **Assessment:**
Site has at least three working, linked pages via navigation.

## **Extra Activities:**
- Add external link to a favorite site in the nav.

## **Reflection / Takeaways:**
Support geniuses who confuse file paths.
