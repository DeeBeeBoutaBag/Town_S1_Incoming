# Lesson Plan: Adding Images & Links in HTML

## **Duration:**
1 hour

## **Lesson Overview:**
Geniuses will learn to add excitement to their web pages with images and links, while understanding how to use attributes like `src`, `alt`, and `href`.

## **Objectives:**
- Properly use `<img>` and `<a>` tags.
- Understand and use attributes (src, href, alt).
- Embed images from both local files and web URLs.

## **Materials:**
- Computers with sample image files or web access
- List of school-safe image URLs
- Code editor

## **Standards:**
- CSTA 2-AP-13, 2-AP-17

## **Lesson Activity:**

### 1. **Introduction (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Excite geniuses about customizing pages.
   - Show funny or cool website images, memes, and how links work IRL.
   - Discuss: “What images would you want on your personal homepage?”

### 2. **Direct Instruction (Time: 15 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Demo using `<img>` and `<a>` tags (attributes, self-closing vs. paired).
   - Show adding image (`<img src="..." alt="...">`) and hyperlink (`<a href="...">Text</a>`) to boilerplate from last class.

### 3. **Guided Practice (Time: 15 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Geniuses add images and links to their own HTML pages.
   - Task: Geniuses work in pairs to add an image and a link (e.g., to Google or ESPN).
   - Discuss relative vs. absolute file paths.

### 4. **Independent Practice (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Personalize and practice.
   - Each genius adds their favorite image, and three links (sports, YouTube, etc).

### 5. **Closure (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Check for understanding.
   - Group share: “Who’s added the funniest/silliest image?” (quick voting)
   - Recap key points on attributes and how to use them.

## **Assessment:**
Genius page must show at least one image and one functioning link.

## **Extra Activities:**
- Add `target="_blank"` to links to open in new tabs.
- Add additional attributes (e.g., `width`, `height`).

## **Reflection / Takeaways:**
Check Geniuses understanding of file paths and attribute syntax.
