   - **Objective:** Activate students’ curiosity about the web.
   - Discuss: "What websites do you use every day?" (sports, games, memes)

   - Show: The simplest HTML file in a code editor and in a browser.

### 3. **Guided Practice (Time: 15 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Geniuses try writing HTML code with teacher guidance.

## **Reflection / Takeaways:**
Note student engagement; adjust pacing if geniuses need more or less intro time.
