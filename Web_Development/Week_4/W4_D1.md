# Lesson Plan: Genius Forms – Collect User Input

## **Duration:**
1 hour

## **Lesson Overview:**
Geniuses get hands-on with HTML forms, learning to gather input from site visitors with text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and more. They’ll make a “Genius Club Sign-Up” form and see how forms power sites across the web!

## **Objectives:**
- Create forms using `<form>`, `<input>`, `<label>`, `<textarea>`, `<button>`.
- Use attributes (type, name, title, placeholder, value).
- Distinguish between radio buttons, checkboxes, and text inputs.

## **Materials:**
- Computers with code editor
- Example form handout/reference
- Whiteboard/Markers

## **Standards:**
- CSTA 2-AP-13, 2-AP-17

## **Lesson Activity:**

### 1. **Introduction (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Connect forms to genius life.
   - Ask: Where have you filled out forms on the web? (games, contests, sign-ups)
   - Show fun/famous forms from gaming or memes.

### 2. **Direct Instruction (Time: 15 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Teach form basics and input types.
   - Demo: Create a basic “Genius Club Sign-Up” form.
   - Explain difference and use for text, email, password, radio, checkbox, etc.

### 3. **Guided Practice (Time: 15 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Build forms together.
   - Each genius adds three input types (text, radio, checkbox) to a simple form.

### 4. **Independent Practice (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Make it personal.
   - Geniuses create a new form section (suggestions, feedback, etc.) on their own.

### 5. **Closure (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Recap input types.
   - Peer review swap for testing forms.
   - Tease: Next class—dropdowns and advanced input!

## **Assessment:**
Form includes at least text, radio, and checkbox input types with working labels.

## **Extra Activities:**
- Add a textarea for “Why are you a genius?” answers.

## **Reflection / Takeaways:**
Help for geniuses that get stuck with input nesting or label connections.
