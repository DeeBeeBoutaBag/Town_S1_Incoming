# Lesson Plan: Dev Tools Genius – Debug & Customize in the Browser

## **Duration:**
1 hour

## **Lesson Overview:**
Geniuses go “under the hood” with browser Dev Tools! They’ll inspect elements, test out wild CSS changes live, and discover how pro web developers experiment and debug on the fly.

## **Objectives:**

- Change styles live and test out ideas instantly.
- Debug broken CSS by seeing real-time results.

Stay mindful of distractions—keep the focus on learning, not just goofing!
