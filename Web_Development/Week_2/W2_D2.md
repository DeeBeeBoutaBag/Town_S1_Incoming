# Lesson Plan: HTML Lists & The Genius Navigation Bar

## **Duration:**
1 hour

## **Lesson Overview:**
Geniuses will explore ordered, unordered, and nested lists. They'll build a navigation bar for their site using `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, and `<a>`â€”unlocking the power to organize and connect multiple HTML pages!

## **Objectives:**
- Properly create ordered and unordered lists.
- Build a functional navigation bar.
- Link to other web pages using `<a>` inside lists.

## **Materials:**
- Computers with code editor
- Diagrams of lists/nav bars
- Sample site links

## **Standards:**
- CSTA 2-AP-13, 2-AP-17

## **Lesson Activity:**

### 1. **Introduction (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Connect lists to everyday genius life.
   - Quick poll: Who keeps lists (chores, gaming rankings, wish lists)? Discuss.
   - Show how websites use navigation menus.

### 2. **Direct Instruction (Time: 15 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Teach list and nav bar basics.
   - Demonstrate creating `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<li>` tags.
   - Step-by-step demo of building a basic nav bar with links.

### 3. **Guided Practice (Time: 15 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Geniuses build a nav bar together.
   - Each genius creates a navigation bar in their `<nav>` using a `<ul>` and `<li>`.
   - Teacher helps as geniuses link each `<li>` to a placeholder page.

### 4. **Independent Practice (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Geniuses expand their navigation genius!
   - Add at least 2 more nav links (real or placeholder).
   - Try a nested dropdown (bonus for early finishers).

### 5. **Closure (Time: 10 minutes)**
   - **Objective:** Summarize genius progress.
   - Challenge: Who can explain the difference between `<ul>` and `<ol>`?
   - Show off impressive nav bars!

## **Assessment:**
Check each genius has a working nav bar with at least 3 links.

## **Extra Activities:**
- Try making a top-5 ranked list of video games in an `<ol>`.

## **Reflection / Takeaways:**
Notice who finishes early; offer bonus challenges next week.
